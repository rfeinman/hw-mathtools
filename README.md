# Overview

These are my completed & graded homeworks for the Fall 2017 version of
Eero Simoncelli's course
[Mathematical Tools for Cognitive and Neural Science](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/math-tools/).
The homeworks were completed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
This repository was made public on 2/1/18, well beyond the
termination of the course.
